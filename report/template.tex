\section{Process}
\begin{itemize}
\item interviews
\begin{itemize}
\item why we chose to interview the people we interview
\item remember to refer to names and title
\end{itemize}
\item Task 1
\begin{itemize}
\item Check how the amount of tweets changed during St Patrick's day.
\item The most important feature of our visualization is that the dynamic cartogram. Users can drag the button on time axis, the cartogram will change to visualize corronsond data  with animation.  Users are able to observe trend easily. Also, it will be a beautiful and readily comprehensible way to do presentation.
\item Our tool also provide an option that visualize the data in small multiples. Users can add several time stamp and view cartogram for each time stamp in another tab. This is useful when user want to check the trend in a specific time interval. 
We also provide traditional line chart, users are able to check trend of data from line chart
\end{itemize}
\item Task 2
\begin{itemize}
\item How football fanâ€™s emotion changed after a score during a match. Do they have correlation?
\item In cartogram, color and shape distortion can represent two attributes. So we plan to use shape distortion represent the number of tweets and color to represent the emotion of those tweets. And the map itself represent another attributes- location. So our visualization can encoding above three attributes at the same time, which is difficult to do in other visualizations. 
\end{itemize}

\item Task 5
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there any area in which St Patrick's day more popular?
\item In cartogram, we can use shape distortion and color to encoding the same attributes, this redundant visualization( Most significant distorted state, and the highest color saturation) helps user locate maximum/minimum value in data easier.
\end{itemize}

\item Task 3
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the distribution of tweets amount for each state?
\item One of the most common task is to check the distribution of data. We provide standard bar chart that (with x-axis is states, and y-axis is an attributes ) that allow user to do this task in our application. 
\end{itemize}
\item Task 4
\begin{itemize}
\item Where and When is the peak of celebration in St Patrick's day. 
\item To check where and when is the peak of celebration in St.Patrick's day, users can check the line chart of data. It shows the trend of data, also it is easy to find peaks in line chart. Users can also browse by dragging time button in cartrogram. It is more useful in presentation.
\end{itemize}
\item Task 6
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare the popularity of St Patrick's day in California and New York
\item Users are allowed to add filters to data. After applying proper filter, users can compare data in two or several states in a certain time stamp or the sum of tweets. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item at first the website show an entrying page that says the name of the project and authors
\item First Page is the main view
\begin{itemize}
\item cartogram itself takes up most of the space
\item left slide bar shows the loaded data
\item right slide bar shows an extra bar graph, for detailed data
\item choice to select colors
\end{itemize}
\item Second page shows small multiples from data points that the user select, and trendline graph.
\begin{itemize}
\item able to choose to delete small multiple
\item able to see the exact trend change from the precise graph
\item choice to select colors
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item how's the usability of the project?
\item difficulties in implementation?
\item did we have to give up any original design thought to make the project more doable?
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item draw some conclusion from discussion
\item summarize about the good parts
\begin{itemize}
\item how did it correspond to our task? were out task goals realistic? how much did they help?
\item any surprise good parts?
\end{itemize}
\item summarize about what we could improve, change, or have done better
\begin{itemize}
\item how could we have designed the interview process to make task analysis more helpful?
\item what other part did we not think about?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
